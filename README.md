# odin-recipes
First challenge of the odin project: a recipe in html.

This is a challenge that the Odin Foundations course introduces when we're
starting to learn html.
I'm supposed to create a website with recipes for something. So far I've
only learned html, so the website won't have a good design.
I've already practiced the concepts of creating boilerplates, placing texts,
lists, links and images with html, so I believe it will be an easy project.
